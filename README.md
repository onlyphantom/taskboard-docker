# Taskboard
A simple todo app style for the Docker lesson that goes over:
- Creating an image
- Updating an image
- Persisting with a database
- Using volumes vs using bind mounts
- Pushing it to Docker Hub

The app itself is built with React, but since that is secondary to the main purpose of learning Docker itself, I don't expect it to matter much.

Link to tutorial videos on my YouTube incoming, and will be updated here on the README.
